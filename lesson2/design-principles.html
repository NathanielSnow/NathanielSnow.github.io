                    The importance of the Law of Proximity is that it allows people to identify "groups" of information that is 
                    related to each other. To do this, it utilizes whitespace to create distance between different groups. This picture of
                    the Boston Globe seems to show that process quite well. They utilize whitespace so that we can separate different paragraphs
                    and images. This helps us read their articles with relative ease.

                    Restaurants tend to be masters of Visual Hierarchy. We can see the strategy just from this small screen shot. 
                    The most prominent "visual" is the food, followed by the prices and the order buttons. You notice that the details 
                    are not as prominent as the food, prices, and order buttons. It's not that it's not as important as the other elements, 
                    let's face it, it's not in the path that they are making our eyes follow

                    Consistency helps portray a sense of unity and makes the website look cool besides. This screenshot shows part of the 
                    WITC homepage. Here they make good use of the yellow and blue colors while also maintaining good proximity.
